Responding to Potential Conversation Stoppers
----------------------------------------------

###Why Important
Imagine that you know that a natural disaster is imminent. People will die unless they flee to safety. You go to a neighbor’s home to warn him, but he interrupts you, saying that he is busy. Surely, you would not quickly abandon your efforts to help him! Many in our territory turn us away, not realizing the life-saving value of our message. At the time of our visit, perhaps they are preoccupied. (Matt. 24:37-39) Or maybe they have been prejudiced by untrue rumors. (Matt. 11:18, 19) They might assume that we are no different from the religions that have produced bad fruitage. (2 Pet. 2:1, 2) If the householder initially is not interested, we should not be quick to give up.

###How to Do It
* Before preaching from house to house, take a few moments to think about potential conversation stoppers that you may encounter and consider how to respond.
* If the householder presents an objection, gently try to continue the conversation. Perhaps you can do that by commending him. For example, if he says that he has his own religion, you might reply, “I was hoping to find someone like you who has an interest in spiritual things.” Sometimes acknowledging the householder’s feelings or circumstances will enable you to continue giving a witness. For instance, if he says that he is busy, you might say: “I understand. But before I leave, I would like to give you this.” Another option is to ask a question if the householder says that he is not interested. You could say, “Do you mean that you are not interested in the Bible, or is it religion in general that does not interest you?”
* Use good judgment. Remember that Jehovah does not force people to listen. (Deut. 30:19) Everyone must carry his own load of spiritual responsibility. (Gal. 6:5) If the householder is adamant, it is best to take our leave. By demonstrating respect for his feelings, we may open the door for another publisher to give a witness in the future. - 1 Pet. 3:15.

### Try This During the Month
When you encounter a potential conversation stopper, after leaving the householder, discuss with your partner how you might have responded in a better way.

Preparing Our Opening Words
----------------------------

###Why Important
If our introduction does not arouse interest, the householder may terminate the conversation before we can give a witness. Therefore, many publishers consider their opening words to be the most important part of their presentation. Although sample presentations are provided in Our Kingdom Ministry and the Reasoning book, they do not always include a complete introduction, in order to allow for flexibility. Even if a sample presentation is complete, publishers may choose to alter it or prepare their own. Thus, we will be more effective if we carefully prepare our opening words rather than say whatever comes to mind when the householder opens the door.​—Prov. 15:28.

###How to Do It
* Choose your topic. It should be based on the literature you are offering and should be of interest to people in your territory.
* Carefully prepare the first sentence or two that you will say after giving a customary greeting. You might start by saying: “I am here because . . . ,” “Many people are concerned about . . . ,” “I would like to get your opinion on . . . ,” or something else. Short, simple sentences usually work best. Some publishers choose to memorize their introduction.
* Formulate a viewpoint question that will draw the householder into the conversation. (Matt. 17:25) Remember that he was likely thinking about other matters before you arrived, so the question should not be too difficult to put him on the spot.

### Try This During the Month
* Set aside time during family worship to prepare and practice your opening words.
* When in the ministry, share what you plan to say with other publishers. (Prov. 27:17) Change your introduction if it is not effective.

Initiating a Conversation in Order to Witness Informally
--------------------------------------------------------

###Why Important
When sharing in the house-to-house ministry, we often find that many people are not at home. However, we may come in contact with them when using public transportation, when waiting in a doctor’s office, when taking a break at work or at school, and so forth. It is Jehovah’s will that everyone has an opportunity to hear the Kingdom message. (1 Tim. 2:3, 4) Often, in order to give a witness, we must take the initiative to start a conversation.”

###How to Do It
* Be selective. Does the person seem friendly and willing to talk? Do the circumstances allow for relaxed conversation? Some publishers first make eye contact with the person and then smile. If the person smiles back, they try to start a conversation.
* Say a brief, silent prayer if you lack the courage to speak.​—Neh. 2:4; Acts 4:29.
* Start with a simple comment, perhaps a greeting. Jesus did not begin his conversation with the Samaritan woman by talking about the Kingdom. (John 4:7) Sometimes a conversation can be initiated by giving commendation: “Your children are so well-behaved!” Asking a question is another possible conversation starter: “Did you see that news report last night?”
* Once the conversation has started, look for an opportunity to introduce the good news, but do not be in a hurry. Allow the conversation to develop naturally. Perhaps you can make a statement that arouses the person’s curiosity and prompts an inquiry. For example, if the conversation is about family matters, you might say, “I found some reliable advice on raising children.” If you are discussing a news item, you could say, “I recently enjoyed reading some good news for a change.” Do not be discouraged if the conversation ends before you can give a witness.
* Carry tracts or other literature that you can give to someone who shows interest.

### Try This During the Month
Each week try to start at least one conversation with the goal of witnessing informally.

Laying the Groundwork for a Return Visit
----------------------------------------

###Why Important
When we find someone who shows interest, we want to return when he will be home so that we can water the seed of truth that we planted. (1 Cor. 3:6) This often requires that before we leave, we lay the groundwork for the return visit by finding out when we may come back. In addition, it is good to leave a question that we will discuss the next time we visit. This will build the householder’s anticipation for the visit, and if the question is answered in the publication we left with him, he will be more likely to read it. Laying the groundwork for the next conversation also makes it easier to call back because the subject for the discussion has already been chosen, and the householder will know what to expect. When we see him again, we can explain that we returned to answer the question that we raised on the last visit and then proceed.”

###How to Do It
* When preparing your house-to-house presentation, also prepare a follow-up question to be answered on the next visit. It could be based on a topic that is discussed in the literature you are offering that day, or it could be a question that is answered in one of our study publications, which you can introduce when you return.
* When concluding your conversation with a person who shows interest, let him know of your desire to talk to him again and then share the follow-up question you prepared. In some territories people are very busy and tend to be reluctant to make an appointment for you to visit them again. In those circumstances, you might say: “Is this usually a good time to find you at home? [Allow for response.] Next week, I’d like to stop by briefly and answer this question . . . If you are too busy when I come, you can just let me know.”
* If you tell the householder that you will return at a specific time, keep your appointment. (Matt. 5:37) At the conclusion of the return visit, lay the groundwork for the next one.”

### Try This During the Month
When preparing your presentation, also prepare a follow-up question to answer next time. Share it with other publishers with whom you are working.

Showing Personal Interest
--------------------------

###Why Important
Jesus viewed people as individuals, and he showed loving personal interest in them. For example, on one occasion Jesus may have sensed some uneasiness in a deaf man, so when he healed him, he did so privately, away from the stares of the crowd. (Mark 7:31-35) He showed consideration for his disciples by recognizing their limitations and not overwhelming them with too much information. (John 16:12) Even in his heavenly position, Jesus shows personal interest. (2 Tim. 4:17) As followers of Christ, we want to imitate him. (1 Pet. 2:21; 1 John 3:16, 18) Furthermore, we will be more effective in our ministry if we show consideration for the householder and take note of his unique circumstances, his interests, and his concerns. He will be more likely to listen if he senses that we are not just on a mission to deliver a message or to leave literature; rather, we are interested in him personally.”

###How to Do It
* Be well-prepared. Relax, smile, and be friendly.
* Be observant. Do you see indications that the person has children? that he enjoys gardening or has pets? that he has certain religious beliefs? Perhaps you can tailor your introduction to fit his circumstances.
* Ask for his opinion, and listen carefully without needlessly interrupting. Maintain eye contact to show that you are listening. Acknowledge his comments, and commend him if you can do so sincerely. Avoid being argumentative.
* Be adaptable. If necessary, adjust your presentation to address the person’s concerns. This may be easier than you think, since our tracts, brochures, and magazines discuss a wide variety of subjects. If you have called at an inopportune time, such as when he is busy, acknowledge that and shorten your presentation.”

### Try This During the Month
* Have a practice session during family worship, or perhaps while in the ministry, in which the publisher must adapt his presentation to address something the householder says.
* During some meeting for field service, the brother conducting could discuss or demonstrate ays to show personal interest.

Demonstrating a Bible Study by Using the Bible Teach Book
----------------------------------------------------------

### Why Important
Many people may not understand what we mean when we say that we offer free home Bible studies. They may think that they have to join a study group or take some sort of correspondence course. Instead of simply _offering_ a study, why not _demonstrate_ a study? In just a few minutes, even on the doorstep, you can _show_ a person what an easy and enlightening experience it can be to study the Bible.

### How to Do It
* After introducing yourself, ask the householder if he is concerned about the future.
* Mention that many people have similar concerns, and show him the table of contents in the Bible Teach book. Explain that this book has easy-to-understand lessons that show why the Bible teaches about the future and other subjects, and ask him what chapter he is interested in.
* Hand him a copy of the book, and direct him to the chapter that he selected. Explain that the questions at the beginning of the chapter are answered in the paragraphs that follow.
* Ask the householder to read the first paragraph if he feels comfortable doing so. Then read the question for that paragraph, and consider the answer together. Look up and discuss scriptures cited in support of the answer. Show him how you have highlighted the answer in your book.
* Consider the next paragraph, but this time ask the householder to try answering the question in his own words.
* Commend him, and make arrangements to return to complete the lesson.
* If appropriate, direct attention to the video on jw.org entitled What Happens at a Bible Study?

### Try This During the Month
* Pray for Jehovah to bless your efforts to start a new Bible study.–Phil. 2:13
* Try to demonstrate a Bible study using the Bible Teach book or show the video What Happens at a Bible Study? at least once while engaging in the ministry.

Responding to an Irate Householder
----------------------------------------------------------

### Why Important
Many that we meet in the ministry are polite. However, Jesus prophesied that some people will hate us. (John 17:14) Therefore, it should not surprise us if we encounter an irate householder. When this occurs, we want to respond in a way that pleases the one whom we represent, Jehovah. (Rom. 12:17-21; 1 Pet. 3:15) Doing so will likely prevent the situation from escalating. It will also give a witness to the householder and any observers, making them more inclined to listen the next time Jehovah’s Witnesses visit.​—2 Cor. 6:3.

### How to Do It
* Maintain a calm and friendly demeanor. This will help defuse the situation. Do not take the householder’s reaction personally. (Eccl. 7:9) He may be upset because of personal problems or because you happened to call at the wrong time. Even if he is irritated by our message, often this is because he has been misled.​—2 Cor. 4:4.
* Reply with mild and gracious words. (Prov. 15:1) Did you wake him up or interrupt him? Although we do not apologize for our work, you could humbly apologize for calling at an inopportune time. Is he angry because of an untrue rumor that he has heard about us? If so, you might say: “I can understand why that would upset you. However, it seems that what you have heard about us is not accurate. May I explain?” Does he object to one of our beliefs, perhaps regarding disfellowshipping or blood? You could say: “I understand. Others have expressed the same concerns. May I show you from the Bible the basis for that teaching?
* If the person is highly agitated, it may be best to take your leave without trying to reply. If he asks that Jehovah’s Witnesses not visit him again, you can assure him that his wishes will be honored.

### Try This During the Month
* Have practice sessions during your family worship.
* After leaving an irate householder, discuss with your partner how you might have responded in a better way.”

Witnessing Through an Intercom
----------------------------------------------------------

### Why Important
Witnessing through an intercom can be intimidating. How can we avoid letting this challenge dampen our zeal for fine works? Keep in mind that witnessing through an intercom may be the only way to reach some people with the good news. (Rom. 10:14) Experience has shown that an effective witness can be given this way. (See the 2011 Yearbook, pp. 65-66, and the 2000 Yearbook, p. 54, par. 3.) Consider the following suggestions.

### How to Do It
* Prepare a brief presentation, and write it out so that you can read it directly to the householder through the intercom. This can boost your confidence. At the outset, explain the purpose of your visit. Use the householder’s name if it is shown on the directory. Conclude by offering to deliver (or leave in the person’s door) a tract or a magazine that will provide more information.
* Maintain a positive viewpoint. Smile and gesture as if you were speaking face-to-face with the person.
* Relax and be conversational. Speak clearly and with good volume. Avoid unnecessary pauses, but do not speak too fast.
* Use good judgment. In large buildings, there may be many intercoms. Perhaps you could choose just three or so to ring, take note of where you left off, and then leave. Residents of the building may become alarmed if we linger in the foyer in order to ring every intercom.

### Try This During the Month
During family worship have practice sessions with the participants facing away from each other.”
